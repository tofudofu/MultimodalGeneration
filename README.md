#Synthesis of Registered Brain Multimodal MRI with Lesions
## Abstract
In a large number of data-driven medical image intelligent processing tasks, the collection and acquisition of medical image data is very difficult, especially registered multimodal medical image data. Synthetic medical image data can alleviate the problem of insufficient data well. In this paper, based on the unsupervised conditional GAN model, we achieve the synthesis of registered multimodal medical images from a random normal distribution matrix, and the corresponding lesion information can be efficiently generated based on the freely selected lesion label.  We conduct a number of validation experiments on BRATS2015 to verify that our synthetic MRI data can be used as pre-trained data or enhanced data in medical image intelligent processing tasks, and they can greatly improve the generalization ability of the model.
